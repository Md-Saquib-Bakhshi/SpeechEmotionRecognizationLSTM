🎧 Speech Emotion Recognition using LSTM

This project performs Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using MFCC features and an LSTM neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

The model is trained once, saved to disk, and reused for prediction without retraining.

🚀 Features

Classifies emotions from speech audio (.wav)

MFCC-based feature extraction using Librosa

LSTM neural network

One-hot encoded emotion labels

Model persistence (.h5)

Training skipped if model already exists

Script-based workflow (no Jupyter notebooks)

Windows-friendly setup

🛠️ Environment Setup (Windows)
1️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

2️⃣ Activate Virtual Environment
venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

📥 Dataset Preparation

Place all .wav audio files inside:

data/audio/


The emotion label is extracted from the filename
(as used in common speech-emotion datasets)

Example:

03-01-05-02-02-01-12.wav
               ↑
            emotion label

🧠 Train the Model

Run:

python train.py

Training behavior:

If models/emotion_lstm.h5 does not exist, the model is trained

After training, the model is saved to:

models/emotion_lstm.h5


If the model already exists, training is skipped automatically

🔮 Predict Emotion from Audio

Use the trained model to predict emotion from a .wav file:

python predict.py --audio data/audio/sample.wav

Example Output:
Predicted emotion index: 3
Confidence: 0.74


Note: Emotion index corresponds to the label encoding used during training.
